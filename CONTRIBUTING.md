# Contribute

If you want to contribute then please submit an issue or pull request early on. This doesn't have to be final submission, but is the easiest way to start a discussion and get in touch.

## Pull requests

All pull requests and changes are welcome. Please adhere to the following:

* code should conform and have linting done by TSLint
* include tests
* include any relevant documentation updates

Always run tests and TSLint before submitting pull requests and make sure you that modifications don't break anything. 
Once you've made a pull request take a look at the [Travis CI build status](https://www.travis-ci.org/wslyvh/rebalancer) and make sure everything is running as you'd expect.


### Creating Pull Requests (PRs)

As a contributor, you're expected to fork this repository, work on your own fork and then submit pull requests. The pull requests will be reviewed and eventually be merged into the main repository. See GitHub's documentation how this works.
